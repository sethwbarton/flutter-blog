## Hi! I'm Seth

#### About Me

I was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona and graduated from Mountain View Highschool in 2014. Go Toros! üêÆ 

I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at Brigham Young University en route to graduate December 2020. Between my first two years as a university student, I spent two years in Atlanta, Georgia as a full-time, volunteer missionary for my church. It was one of the best experiences of my life! Since then, I've gotten married, got some 'real' jobs, and am looking for full time placement after I graduate. 

##### üë©‚ÄçüöÄ My Work Experience 

###### Operations and Support Center Analyst - BYU OIT (September 2017 - September 2019)

- This was my first "tech" job and I loved it. My job was to help the campus community with whatever IT problems they faced. And in the event of a large outage, I hopped on the Operations table to help developers, managers, and stake holders communicate and resolve the outage. During these outages, we were also in charge of the BYU OIT twitter feed - which was some serious responsibility. 

###### Software Developer - BYU OIT (September 2019 - Current)

- I had always been looking for a development job and when a position opened up with OIT and I received support from my managers at the Operations and Support Center I jumped at the opportunity. Now I get to live the dream of writing excellent code for an excellent company while I'm still in school! 

#### üî≠ Current Projects 

##### Personal

- I really want an awesome website to show off my skills and write some blog posts on. But what is a website about a developer if they weren't the one who created it? I want to make my website with Flutter Web based around Markdown documents for my blog posts. You can check out what I have so far at [sethwbarton.com](https://sethwbarton.com)
- I want to see what's on the other side of the galaxy, learn more about star systems and planets, and contribute to something unique. That's why I'm going on an expedition in my favorite video game: [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/). Expedition [Murcury's Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)) departs on November 22nd, 2020 and returns January 17th, 2021. I'll be working with about 75 other players to bring a new space station to the outer edge of the Milky Way. If you want to learn more, check it out [here](https://www.edsm.net/en/expeditions/summary/id/111/name/Expedition+Mercury%27s+Wings+%5BDSSA%5D). 

##### Work

- As a part time developer at Brigham Young University's Office of Information Technology, I'm helping to develop a replacement of the current Academic Information Management System. It's a big project! The old system was written in C in about 2001. The legendary developers at BYU at the time created a framework in pure C that would render HTML much like Vue.js would today. But that framework's time is drawing to a close and we are replacing it with a stack we lovingly call "[Nauvoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauvoo,_Illinois)" - Node.js + Vue.js. 

##### School

- Door to door salesmen and saleswomen have a difficult job. A project some fellow students and I are passionately working on is Knocked - an app for salesmen and saleswomen to know where to go, who to talk to, and who to mention. You can check it out at [knocked.sethwbarton.com](https://knocked.sethwbarton.com). (Pssst.. I made the website with Flutter!)

#### üå± What I'm Learning Right Now 

- AWS. I use AWS at work and at home daily! All of my personal websites are hosted on AWS, I've created lots of DynamoDB tables, I've set up CloudFront distributions, made SSL certificates, Beanstalks, Lambdas - you name it.  But I've never received a certification. That's why I'm currently studying to take the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam with hopes to move on to the AWS Cloud Developer exam next. 
- I love using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to develop cross-platform apps. I've never had a developer experience quite as graceful and quite as rewarding. Nowadays, when I've got an itch to make something, you'll likely catch me using Flutter. But it's a deep framework and I still have a lot to learn! 

#### üé∏ Fun Fact 

I can play guitar! I love the blues. My current favorite is [Chris "Kingfish" Ingram's "Empty Promises"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-nTAgOMK7w). His guitar face is inspiring.
