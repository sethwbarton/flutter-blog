## "The Fellowship of The Ring" - What I Learned

I try, and mostly fail, to finish a good book periodically. What do I mean by a good book? Well, I'd say a good book is any book that can teach me something I didn't realize before. That something can be some bit of emotional knowledge I needed, maybe a bit of technical knowledge, or even historical knowledge. It doesn't matter what it is, just so long as I learned it. 

Recently, I've decided I would like to read classics. I'd consider a classic a good book. After all, there's a reason they're classics - they taught people things! And they can teach me things too. A while ago (before this website was created) I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Scarlett Letter" - re-living my sophomore year of high school. I learned new things from those re-readings. Maybe I'll write about those later. I decided I felt good about reading those and I liked how they looked on my book shelf - so now I'm reading more classics and recently I've delved into the world of Middle Earth and the tale of a few hobbits - The Lord of the Rings. 

The timeline for my reading of the first in the Lord of the Rings trilogy reflects the vastness of the series itself. It took me months of periodically listening to an audio book to get about half-way through. I finally came across a physical copy I purchased, which, along with a few family beach trips, sped things up a bit. But the pace with which I finished the book was still quite slow. 

Although the pace was slow and my memory of the jargon faint enough each time I re-entered to warrant a refresher course in the lore of Middle Earth, I did find that I learned significant lessons - which I'll share with you here. 

### 1. Light after Darkness

The first thing I took from this book seems like the sort of thing you'd get only after finishing the series. But trust me, there's plenty of light and dark contrasts in "The Fellowship of the Ring" to make anyone realize that there can always be light after it gets dark. I'll put an excerpt here to see if you catch what I mean:

> 'I wanted the truth. It was important. Magic rings are — well, magical; and they are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have had it quite long enough. You won't need it any more, Bilbo....' [said Gandalf]
>
> Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. 'Why not?' he cried. 'And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I [found](http://www.henneth-annun.net/resources/events_view.cfm?evid=939) it. It came to me.'
>
> 'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.'
>
> 'If I am it is your fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious.'
>
> The wizard's face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. 'It has been called that before,' he said, 'but not by you.'
>
> 'But I say it now. And why not? Even if [Gollum](http://www.henneth-annun.net/resources/bios_view.cfm?scid=41) said the same once. It's not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.'
>
> Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. 'You will be a fool if you do, Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.'
>
> 'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' said Bilbo obstinately.
>
> 'Now, now, my dear hobbit!' said Gandalf. 'All your long life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up!"
>
> 'Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you won't get it. I won't give my precious away, I tell you.' His hand strayed to the hilt of his small [sword](http://www.henneth-annun.net/resources/things_view.cfm?thid=9).
>
> Gandalf's eyes flashed. 'It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. 'If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.' He took a step towards the [hobbit](http://www.henneth-annun.net/resources/bios_view.cfm?scid=122), and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.
>
> Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf's eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.
>
> 'I don't know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn't it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not a thief, whatever he said.'
>
> 'I have never called you one,' Gandalf answered. 'And I am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.' He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.
>
> Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. 'I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an [eye](http://www.henneth-annun.net/resources/bios_view.cfm?scid=62) looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and [disappear](http://www.henneth-annun.net/resources/events_view.cfm?evid=1167), don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn't rest without it in my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my mind.'

Within seconds, Bilbo's home becomes a dark, menacing place and within seconds it's put back together again - light and cozy, as a hobbit hole should be. First, Gandalf says there's no need to be "angry". His face becomes "grave" and "attentive". Gandalf was "startled" and "alarmed" by Bilbo's reaction the suggestion that he give up his "precious" ring. Clearly, the ring has a grip on Bilbo. Then at the climax of the darkness, Gandalf's shadow fills the room, he threatens Bilbo, and apparently begins to look larger - whether by a magic trick of his or due to Bilbo's timidity it's hard to tell. This is pitch darkness. There is fear and anger in the room.

But then the room lightens. Bilbo realizes he needs to give the ring up. He describes leaving it as a relief. And Gandalf makes it clear he's not trying to rob, but to help. Then suddenly he's back to a bent and troubled old man - not a menacing wizard-lord. 

I love this theme of things turning dark and then light. This happens throughout the book. And surely this isn't a new thing in literature, but I just noticed it. 

### 2. Friendship above Fear

One of the most heartwrenching moments in "The Fellowship of the Ring" is at the very end: 

> “It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam," said Frodo, "and I could not have borne that."
>
> "Not as certain as being left behind," said Sam.
>
> "But I am going to Mordor."
>
> "I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you.”

The dogged determination of Sam to stick with Frodo no matter the cost is not always obvious when reading the books - especially in the middle of the book, in Lothlorien, when Sam clearly has doubts about whether he wants to continue this journey. But, after seeing the "elf-magic" of Galadriel's mirror and what we can only assume would be a shire with the ring still in the world, Sam's determination and persistent attitude become set in stone. And this excerpt is where those attributes shine. I wish I was a friend like Sam, never fearing but always counting on a brighter future. Or, at least, the prevention of a darker one. Sam was willing to go to near certain death to stick with his friend and save his home - that's true selflesness. 

### 3. Hope above Despair

The third lesson was the most cogent for me: 

> "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."

This beautiful quote comes from the rather unimportant character of Haldir, an elven guard in Lothlorien. And even though I think the character is unimportant (he's only around for a  few chapters), he has what I consider the best one-liner in the book. Especially in the year 2020, I think Haldir's message is needed. We cannot afford to forget what is good in the world and we must realize that the dark times and places may serve to better our nations and our world. 

It's especially important to realize that Haldir's world was ending as he spoke these words - and there was no way out. The loss of the rings of power and the beginning of the exodus of elven-kind meant that the age of elves was drawing to a close. Even if Frodo was successful in his mission and Sauran was driven back, magic would still wane from middle-earth. There was no way out of this ending for the elves. Soon it would be the age of men. Magic would cease from middle-earth and so elven-kind would have to go. Now, my understanding of this part of the lore is suspect, but I think Haldir knew this fact and was still optimistic. Whether he was optimistic that he would find a new home across the sea or that mankind would be able to rebiuld better is unclear. Either way, I hope I can incorporate his outlook into my life - perhaps I would brighten someone's day.
