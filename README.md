My Blog 2.0

This is no longer the source code for sethwbarton.com but it was for a long time. I'm keeping it here in GitHub for the generations that come after me or to remind 
myself of the kinds of things that I wrote. You should be able to start this code by following the instructions below. Or if you just want to read the articles I posted check out `web/assets/posts`.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
